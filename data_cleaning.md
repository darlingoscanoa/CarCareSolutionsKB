# Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing our app usage data for analysis. It involves identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers to ensure the quality and reliability of our data.

## Importance of Data Cleaning

Clean data is essential for:
- Accurate analysis and insights
- Reliable machine learning models
- Informed decision-making

## Key Data Cleaning Techniques

### 1. Handling Missing Data

Missing data can significantly impact our analysis. Here are some strategies to handle it:

#### a) Identifying Missing Data

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('app_usage_data.csv')

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Visualize missing data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False, yticklabels=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Data Heatmap')
plt.show()
